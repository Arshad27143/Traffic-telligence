        <h1>About TrafficTelligence</h1>
        <p>This application uses machine learning algorithms to estimate traffic volume based on various inputs.Input data like weather conditions, holidays, and time to get a prediction of traffic volume.</p>

        <p>Advanced Traffic Volume Estimation with Machine Learning is an application to develop an advanced traffic management system that utilizes machine learning algorithms for accurate estimation and prediction of traffic volumes. The system aims to enhance traffic management, urban planning, and commuter experiences by providing precise traffic forecasts based on historical data and various influencing factors.</p>

        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Traffic Volume Prediction:</strong> Employ machine learning algorithms to analyze historical traffic data, weather conditions, special events, and other relevant factors to predict future traffic volumes.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Traffic Management:</strong> Provide real-time traffic estimations to enable transportation authorities to implement adaptive traffic control measures, optimize signal timings, and adjust lane configurations, thereby reducing congestion.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Urban Development Planning:</strong> Equip city planners and developers with insights into future traffic patterns, facilitating effective planning of infrastructure projects, road networks, public transit systems, and commercial zones to enhance accessibility and efficiency.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Commuter Guidance and Navigation:</strong> Offer accurate traffic volume forecasts to individual commuters and navigation apps, allowing for intelligent route planning, real-time updates, and alternative route suggestions to improve overall travel experiences.</li><br>
